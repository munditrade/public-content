# ![Bag](/icons/bag.svg 'Bag')The Company
We believe that international trade is good for the world and that every business should have access to global markets, regardless of where they are based.

[Mundi](http://mundi.io/) exists to empower companies to trade globally, connecting the world and reducing barriers to economic opportunity. We have created the first digital Payments and Financing solution for cross-border trade. Today Small and Medium Businesses have trouble accessing global markets, which results in Billions in sales lost every year.

We are looking for the best people to come to work for our company; people who are highly driven, hands-on, and love doing things the right way.
