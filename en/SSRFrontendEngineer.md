# ![Award](/icons/award.svg 'Award')What’s Our Tech Stack
This is a non-exhaustive summary, but enough to give you an idea.

Since we are a data-focused startup, we’ve decided on using Google Cloud Platform as our cloud provider, they have a great set of data products built on top of a huge open source community, and with great pricing.

We use Kubernetes (GKE) because we have deep experience with it and we’ve been able to build some pretty powerful things on top of it easily (e.g. our data pipelines with Argo, and CI/CD with Rio).

Miniservices architecture (not quite micro), we try to follow DDD (Domain Driven Design) principles, and more importantly continuously refactor as we build and evolve our codebase.

We are using Node.js and Python as our main programming languages (Node for most of our services, and Python for our data pipelines and models).

On the frontend side, React with hooks, css-in-js, and Next.js.

- Experience working with CI/CD (PRs, code reviews, etc.)

If there’s things you don’t know well, but are eager to learn and put in the time to do so, contact us, at the end of the day we value passion and curiosity more than one or two specific skills.
