# ![Star](/icons/star.svg 'Star')Who Are We Looking For
Are you curious and passionate?
Learning and testing new things keeps you awake at night?
Are you frequently switching between pragmatism and perfectionism (getting things done, while doing them in the best possible way)?
Do you love coffee, silly memes and jokes, getting together for the occasional beer, and having heated discussions about tech (from tabs vs spaces, to distributed systems and ML)?

# ![Award](/icons/award.svg 'Award')What’s Our Tech Stack
This is a non-exhaustive summary, but enough to give you an idea.

Since we are a data-focused startup, we’ve decided on using Google Cloud Platform as our cloud provider, they have a great set of data products built on top of a huge open source community, and with great pricing.

We use Kubernetes (GKE) because we have deep experience with it and we’ve been able to build some pretty powerful things on top of it easily (e.g. our data pipelines with Argo, and CI/CD with Rio).

Miniservices architecture (not quite micro), we try to follow DDD (Domain Driven Design) principles, and more importantly continuously refactor as we build and evolve our codebase.

We are using Node.js and Python as our main programming languages (Node for most of our services, and Python for our data pipelines and models).

On the frontend side, React with hooks, css-in-js, and Next.js.

# ![Lens](/icons/lens.svg 'Lens')Sr. Backend/Data Engineer (Python / opt. Node.js) (Full-time)
As a member of our team you’ll help us build our backend platform and data pipelines, literally the core of our platform.

You’ll be expected to autonomously work and deliver features, as well as help the rest of the team grow and succeed.
For this you need to be experienced with our tech stack some key best practices, special focus on:
- Python (good understanding of the Python API)
- Experience working with Docker containers in cloud environments.
- Experienced in building testable code, no change is pushed without the corresponding changes to its test case.
- Experience with the Python data ecosystem (Pandas, Numpy, Jupyter).
- Experience developing systems with a microservice architecture (e.g. monitoring and resiliency patterns, data and state management, scaling, etc.)
- Experience working with CI/CD (PRs, code reviews, etc.)

Things that we value (but are not must haves):
- Experience building services using Node.js (big plus)
- Understanding of event driven architectures
- Understanding of DDD (domain driven design)
- Machine learning / data science experience (or interest) (e.g. ScikitLearn, Tensorflow/Keras)
- Experience building APIs with Graphql/Apollo (e.g. with subscriptions)
- Experience working with Kubernetes and Google Cloud

If there’s things you don’t know well, but are eager to learn and put in the time to do so, contact us, at the end of the day we value passion and curiosity more than one or two specific skills.
