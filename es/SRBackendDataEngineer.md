# The Company
Mundi is the first digital Payments and Financing solution for cross-border trade. We believe that international trade is good for the world and that we can help SMEs trade an extra [US$ 1.5 Trillion per year.](https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/359631/adb-briefs-83.pdf) Mexico is the first market where we are tackling this global problem.
We are pre-launch and VC backed by [FJ Labs.](http://www.fjlabs.com) 

We are a young and small startup with our headquarters in New York city, our operations team in Mexico, and our tech team initially being built in Buenos Aires, Argentina.


# Our Team
We have an amazing team of talented individuals with extensive experience in tech, business and operations.
This is not our first rodeo, we each come from building and working on startups, scaling them to tens of millions of users and billions in valuation.
We are an honest, hard working, and supportive team, obsessed with building incredible products.


# What To Expect
Learning is at our core. We challenge ourselves and each other every day, and continuously teach what we learn in our journey.
You will find your limits at Mundi, and together we will help you push through (that’s learning).
We will teach you everything we know, and learn a lot together as well.

We believe in autonomy and responsibility, you won’t be micromanaged into oblivion here. 
You’ll be guided and supported in every possible way, but also pushed to do the best possible work.


# Who Are We Looking For
Are you curious and passionate?
Learning and testing new things keeps you awake at night?
Are you frequently switching between pragmatism and perfectionism (getting things done, while doing them in the best possible way)?
Do you love coffee, silly memes and jokes, getting together for the occasional beer, and having heated discussions about tech (from tabs vs spaces, to distributed systems and ML)?


# What’s Our Tech Stack
This is a non-exhaustive summary, but enough to give you an idea.

Since we are a data-focused startup, we’ve decided on using Google Cloud Platform as our cloud provider, they have a great set of data products built on top of a huge open source community, and with great pricing.

We use Kubernetes (GKE) because we have deep experience with it and we’ve been able to build some pretty powerful things on top of it easily (e.g. our data pipelines with Argo, and CI/CD with Rio).

Miniservices architecture (not quite micro), we try to follow DDD (Domain Driven Design) principles, and more importantly continuously refactor as we build and evolve our codebase.

We are using Node.js and Python as our main programming languages (Node for most of our services, and Python for our data pipelines and models).

On the frontend side, React with hooks, css-in-js, and Next.js.


# Compensation Package
We offer a competitive compensation package comprised of:
* Great salaries in US Dollars.
* Generous stock option package (1yr cliff, 4yr vesting).
* Three (3) weeks paid vacation off-time (you can ask for more if you need them).
* Brand new MacBook Pro (last gen.)
* Work from home days, but we are also setting up an office to get together and speed things up when needed (with hot coffee every day, and cold beer on Fridays).
eLearning platform (ACM membership, O’Reilly SafariOnline).
* Yearly Amazon.com credit.
* Potential for travel across our offices as the company grows.

# Sr. Backend/Data Engineer (Python / opt. Node.js) (Full-time)
As a member of our team you’ll help us build our backend platform and data pipelines, literally the core of our platform.

You’ll be expected to autonomously work and deliver features, as well as help the rest of the team grow and succeed.
For this you need to be experienced with our tech stack some key best practices, special focus on:
* Python (good understanding of the Python API)
* Experience working with Docker containers in cloud environments.
* Experienced in building testable code, no change is pushed without the corresponding changes to its test case.
* Experience with the Python data ecosystem (Pandas, Numpy, Jupyter).
* Experience developing systems with a microservice architecture (e.g. monitoring and resiliency patterns, data and state management, scaling, etc.)
* Experience working with CI/CD (PRs, code reviews, etc.)

Things that we value (but are not must haves):
* Experience building services using Node.js (big plus)
* Understanding of event driven architectures
* Understanding of DDD (domain driven design)
* Machine learning / data science experience (or interest) (e.g. ScikitLearn, Tensorflow/Keras)
* Experience building APIs with Graphql/Apollo (e.g. with subscriptions)
* Experience working with Kubernetes and Google Cloud

If there’s things you don’t know well, but are eager to learn and put in the time to do so, contact us, at the end of the day we value passion and curiosity more than one or two specific skills.
